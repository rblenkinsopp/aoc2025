# Advent of Code 2025

This is a set of [rust](https://rust-lang.org) solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)
puzzles.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are written to be benchmarked using [AoCBench](https://github.com/ShaneMcC/AoCBench). They are therefore tuned for speed and
nothing else, normally throwing safety to the wind. These should not be judged to be good samples of Rust
at all and are not intended to be.
